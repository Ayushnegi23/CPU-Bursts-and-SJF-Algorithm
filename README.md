# CPU-Bursts-and-SJF-Algorithm
If there are 5 positive integers in the first line of the text file then the program treat those argument as required CPU bust for P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 process and calculate average waiting time and average turn around time. Consider used scheduling algorithm as SJF and same arrival time for all the processes.
